# Research Prompt: Sonique Audio Player Interface Design

**Date:** December 18, 2025  
**For:** Gemini (or external researcher)  
**Context:** Designing Cortana Personal AI interface - need Sonique inspiration  
**Purpose:** Understand what made Sonique interfaces so innovative and cool

---

## Background

We're designing an interface for a personal AI assistant (Cortana, Halo-inspired). The user remembers **Sonique** - an early 2000s audio player known for experimental, curved, non-rectangular interfaces that were WAY cooler than standard Winamp skins.

We want to understand:
- What made Sonique special?
- How were the interfaces designed?
- What technical tricks did they use?
- What can we learn/steal for a modern interface?

---

## Research Questions

### 1. What Was Sonique?

**Core Questions:**
- What was Sonique (the audio player)?
- When was it popular? (years)
- Who created it?
- What made it different from Winamp/other players?
- Why do people remember it fondly?

**Look For:**
- Company/developer info
- Release timeline
- Key features that stood out
- Why it was "experimental"
- What happened to it (still exists?)

---

### 2. Interface Design Philosophy

**Core Questions:**
- What was unique about Sonique's visual design?
- How did it break conventions?
- What made it "cool" vs other audio players?

**Specific Design Elements to Research:**
- **Curved interfaces** (not rectangular windows)
- **Non-standard shapes** (organic vs boxy)
- **Animations** (what kinds?)
- **Color schemes** (palettes used)
- **Transparency/effects** (glass, glow, etc.)
- **Visualizations** (audio-reactive graphics)

**Find:**
- Screenshots of different Sonique skins/modes
- Descriptions of the interface
- Design principles (if documented)
- What was possible in early 2000s tech

---

### 3. Technical Implementation

**Core Questions:**
- How did they make non-rectangular windows work?
- What graphics technology was used?
- How were skins/themes implemented?
- What file formats?
- Any technical documentation?

**Look For:**
- Window transparency/masking techniques
- Graphics libraries used (DirectX? OpenGL?)
- Skin file formats (.s2t? .skn? something else?)
- Any developer docs or wikis
- Community mods/customizations

**Why This Matters:**
- Need to know what's possible
- Modern equivalents (Electron? Native? Web?)
- Performance considerations
- Animation techniques

---

### 4. Visual Examples & Gallery

**Core Questions:**
- What did Sonique actually look like?
- Different versions/skins?
- Best examples of the design?

**Find and Provide:**
- **20-30 screenshots** of Sonique interfaces
  - Different skins if available
  - Various states (playing, idle, etc.)
  - Visualizer modes
  - Settings/menus
- Annotate: What makes each example cool?
- Identify: Common design patterns

**Priority:**
- High-quality screenshots
- Variety of designs
- Clear examples of the "curved/experimental" style

---

### 5. Comparison to Other Players

**Core Questions:**
- How did Sonique compare to:
  - Winamp (traditional skinning)
  - foobar2000 (extreme customization)
  - iTunes (Apple design)
  - Windows Media Player (default/boring)

**Find:**
- Side-by-side comparisons (if available)
- Reviews from the era
- User feedback
- What Sonique did better
- What Sonique did worse
- Why people chose it

---

### 6. Modern Equivalents & Legacy

**Core Questions:**
- Does Sonique still exist?
- Modern players inspired by it?
- Any spiritual successors?
- Open source versions?

**Look For:**
- Current status of Sonique
- Projects inspired by it
- Design trends it influenced
- Modern tools with similar aesthetics
- Community preservation efforts

---

### 7. Design Lessons for Our Project

**Core Questions:**
- What principles can we apply to Cortana?
- What worked well?
- What should we avoid?
- How to achieve "cool factor" today?

**Extract:**
- 5-10 key design principles
- "What made it work" analysis
- Modern implementation approaches
- Cautionary tales (what didn't work)

---

## Specific Use Case: Cortana Interface

**Our Project:**
- Personal AI assistant (Halo-themed)
- Chat interface (user input + AI responses)
- Desktop app (menu bar resident)
- Needs to be COOL (factor = 1000)
- Animated Cortana hologram (top section)
- Want non-boring, non-rectangular design

**Questions Specific to Our Needs:**
1. How to make a chat window NOT boring?
2. Curved interfaces for modern desktop apps?
3. Animations without being distracting?
4. How to balance cool vs usable?
5. Skin system like Sonique had?

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Overview Document

**Title:** "Sonique Audio Player: Design Analysis for Cortana Interface"

**Sections:**
- What was Sonique? (history, context)
- Interface design philosophy
- Technical implementation
- Visual examples (screenshots embedded or linked)
- Comparison to other players
- Modern equivalents and legacy
- Design lessons for Cortana

**Length:** 5-10 pages (thorough!)

---

### 2. Visual Gallery

**Format:** Images or links to images

**Contents:**
- 20-30 Sonique interface screenshots
- Variety of skins/modes
- Annotated (what's cool about each)
- Organized by theme/style

**Bonus:** GIFs/videos if available (animations!)

---

### 3. Design Principles List

**Format:** Numbered list

**Title:** "What Made Sonique Cool: Principles for Cortana"

**Contents:**

---

## Timeline

**No rush!** This is for interface design documentation phase.

**Suggested:** 1-2 days for thorough research and compilation.

---

## Key Focus

**Remember:** We don't just want facts about Sonique. We want to understand:
- **WHY it was cool**
- **HOW they achieved it**
- **WHAT we can learn**

Focus on extracting design wisdom, not just history.

---

## Questions?

If anything is unclear:
1. Focus on the visual/design aspects
2. Screenshots are gold (the more, the better)
3. Understanding "cool factor" is key
4. How to apply to modern app is the goal

---

**Researcher Note:** Erik remembers Sonique fondly from early 2000s. It had curved, experimental interfaces that broke all the rules. We're trying to capture that spirit for a modern AI assistant interface. Your research will directly inform our design!

**This is going to be SO cool.** 🎨✨
