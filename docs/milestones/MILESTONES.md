# Hologram Project Milestones

**Visual history of building something impossible** 📸✨

---

## December 19, 2025 - Phase 0 Complete: First Window

**Screenshot:** `2025-12-19_phase-0-complete.png`

**What happened:**
- ✅ Electron app successfully launched
- ✅ Frameless, transparent window working
- ✅ Glassmorphism effect rendering
- ✅ Cortana-inspired blue/purple gradient
- ✅ Custom title bar and window controls
- ✅ Three.js dependency installed (visualizer next!)
- ✅ Security foundation designed (local-only, zero telemetry)
- ✅ Roadmap reviewed by 7 different AIs (unprecedented consensus)
- ✅ Git repository initialized
- ✅ npm project configured

**Why it matters:**
This is the moment Hologram went from "ambitious idea" to "real thing running on screen." The window already looks "impossible" - translucent, floating, alien. And we haven't even added the particle sphere yet.

**Erik's reaction:** "man this is a badass project" 🔥

**Next:** Phase 1 begins - add Three.js hologram visualizer, build Security Layer foundation, implement offline resilience.
