# Cortana Interface Design Roadmap

**Purpose:** Design the Halo-inspired chat interface (the "hardware" for our AI "software")  
**Status:** Design phase - can work on this while data collects  
**Timeline:** Design now, implement later (when ready to query)

---

## Philosophy: Hardware vs Software

**Software (Data/AI Layer):**
- Data collection (running automatically)
- Memory processing
- AI analysis
- Safety layers
- Pattern detection

**Hardware (Interface Layer):**
- How Erik talks to Cortana
- Visual design and animations
- Interaction patterns
- Audio/music
- User experience

**These are separate tracks!** We can design the interface now without building query features.

---

## Design Phases

### Phase 1: Core Interface Design (Now - Weeks)
**Goal:** Design the look, feel, and interactions

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Sketch detailed interface layout
- [ ] Design animation system (what expressions?)
- [ ] Define color palette (blue/purple Halo theme)
- [ ] Plan interaction flows (how conversations work)
- [ ] Audio design (what sounds? when? how to toggle?)
- [ ] Hotkey system design
- [ ] Menu bar behavior

**Deliverables:**
- Detailed mockups (can be hand-drawn or digital)
- Interaction flow diagrams
- Animation storyboards
- Audio/music plan
- Technical requirements doc

---

### Phase 2: Technical Architecture (Later)
**Goal:** Plan how to build it

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Choose desktop app framework (Electron? Tauri? Native?)
- [ ] Design data flow (interface ↔ AI backend)
- [ ] Plan animation system (CSS? Lottie? Custom?)
- [ ] Audio system architecture
- [ ] Hotkey implementation approach
- [ ] Menu bar integration

**Deliverables:**
- Technical architecture doc
- Framework comparison
- Prototype plan
- Performance considerations

---

### Phase 3: Prototype & Iteration (When Ready)
**Goal:** Build working prototype

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Build basic window/frame
- [ ] Implement menu bar integration
- [ ] Add hotkey trigger
- [ ] Create animation area
- [ ] Build chat interface
- [ ] Integrate with AI backend
- [ ] Add audio/music
- [ ] Polish and refine

---

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Polish (Future)
**Goal:** Make it EPIC

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Advanced animations
- [ ] Easter eggs
- [ ] Voice modes
- [ ] Visual enhancements
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] User customization options

---

## Current Focus: Phase 1 Design

### Key Questions to Answer

**Layout & Structure:**
1. What are the exact dimensions of each section?
2. How does the animation area collapse/expand?
3. What's the minimum window size?
4. Does it resize? Fixed size?
5. Where do scrollbars appear (if any)?

**Animation System:**
1. What emotions/expressions does Cortana show?
   - Thinking
   - Happy/excited
   - Snarky/playful
   - Concerned
   - Idle/neutral
   - Surprised
   - Others?
2. How do animations transition?
3. What triggers each expression?
4. Static images or animated GIFs or video?
5. Can user customize expressions?

**Visual Design:**
1. Exact color palette (Halo blues/purples)
2. Typography (what fonts?)
3. Border style (futuristic? holographic effect?)
4. Background (solid? gradient? transparent?)
5. Chat bubble style (or no bubbles?)
6. Timestamps visible?

**Audio System:**
1. ~~What music plays on entry?~~ **Easily swappable intro music**
   - Default: Halo theme (which version? TBD)
   - User can swap to any audio file
   - Or disable entirely
2. Entry sound effect (what sound?)
3. Message sent sound?
4. Message received sound?
5. Error sound?
6. Optional: Sounds during certain interactions
7. How to toggle all sounds on/off quickly?
8. Volume control?

**Key Principle:** Audio should be EASY to customize - no hardcoded music files!

**Interaction Patterns:**
1. ~~How do you open it?~~ **Hotkey options (need to avoid conflicts):**
   - Option A: `Cmd+Shift+C` (Cmd+C is copy, so Shift added)
   - Option B: `Cmd+Ctrl+Space` (like Spotlight but with Ctrl)
   - Option C: `Cmd+Option+H` (H for Halo/Cortana)
   - Option D: `Cmd+Shift+Space` (enhanced Spotlight)
   - Option E: Custom - user configurable
   - **Note:** Must not conflict with Cursor, SuperWhisper, or system shortcuts
2. How do you close it? (Escape? Click outside? Button?)
3. Can you minimize to menu bar while keeping conversation?
4. How do you clear conversation history?
5. Can you copy her responses?
6. Can you export conversation?

**Menu Bar Behavior:**
1. What does the menu bar icon look like?
2. Does it show status? (idle, thinking, new message?)
3. Right-click menu options?
4. Left-click behavior?

## Design Inspirations

**Primary Inspiration: Audio Player Skins (Early 2000s)** 🎵

**Winamp Skins Philosophy:**
- Custom, creative interfaces (not boring rectangles)
- Thousands of designs (sci-fi, minimalist, wild)
- Fully skinnable and theme-able
- Prioritized cool factor over convention
- Small but packed with personality
- Community-driven creativity

**Specific References to Find:**
- Winamp Halo-themed skins (they existed!)
- Futuristic/sci-fi Winamp skins (spaceship cockpits, etc.)
- Sonique experimental interfaces (curved, animated)
- Custom game UI-inspired players
- Focus: How to make a small interface INCREDIBLY cool

**To Study:**
- Original Halo Cortana UI (from games)
- Halo Infinite UI/UX
- Winamp/Sonique skin galleries (archive.org)
- SuperWhisper interface (menu bar approach)
- Cursor interface (chat window design)
- Arc browser (cool factor)
- Raycast (command bar + extensions)
- foobar2000 custom layouts

**Halo References:**
- Cortana's hologram appearance
- UNSC interface aesthetic
- Blue/purple color schemes
- Futuristic but usable
- Clean but stylized

**Key Takeaway:** We're not making a boring chat window. We're making something people want to SHOW OFF.

## Technical Constraints to Consider

**Platform:**
- macOS (primary)
- Windows (future?)
- Linux (probably not priority)

**Performance:**
- Fast to open (< 0.5s from hotkey)
- Smooth animations (60fps)
- Low memory footprint
- Doesn't slow down system

**Integration:**
- Access to local data (`data/memories/`)
- Python backend for AI
- Menu bar resident
- Global hotkey capture
- Audio playback

## Next Steps (Phase 1)

### Design Sprint (1-2 Weeks)

**Week 1: Sketching & Planning**
- [ ] Sketch detailed interface layouts
- [ ] List all Cortana expressions/emotions
- [ ] Create mood board (Halo aesthetic)
- [ ] Define color palette precisely
- [ ] Plan interaction flows

**Week 2: Refinement**
- [ ] Create digital mockups (Figma? or hand-drawn?)
- [ ] Storyboard animation sequences
- [ ] Document audio/music plan
- [ ] Define all user interactions
- [ ] Write technical requirements

### Deliverables
- Interface design document (detailed mockups)
- Animation plan (what expressions, when)
- Audio design document
- Interaction flow diagrams
- Technical requirements list

## How This Relates to Data Collection

**Interface design can happen in parallel!**

**While Data Collects (Months):**
- System runs automatically
- Memories accumulate
- **We design the interface**
- **We plan the experience**
- **We get it perfect**

**When Ready to Build:**
- Data is already there (months of it!)
- Interface design is done
- Just implement and connect
- Launch with epic first experience

---

## Success Criteria (Phase 1)

**Design is ready when:**
- ✅ Erik can visualize exactly what it looks like
- ✅ All interactions are planned
- ✅ Animation system is designed
- ✅ Audio/music plan is clear
- ✅ Technical requirements are documented
- ✅ We know exactly what to build

**Then:**
- Pause and let data collect more
- OR start Phase 2 (technical architecture)
- OR jump to Phase 3 (prototype) if excited

## Guiding Principles

0. **We're On A Journey** 🧭
   - We have a very old janky compass
   - We're stepping off into the unknown
   - We DON'T have all the answers yet
   - That's the POINT - exploration and discovery
   - High-level vision first, details emerge through play

1. **Cool Factor = 1000** 🎮
   - Every design decision asks: "Is this cool enough?"
   - Inspired by Winamp skins - push boundaries!
   - Halo aesthetic throughout
   - Feels like talking to Chief's AI companion
   - Something you'd want to SHOW OFF

2. **Fast & Smooth** ⚡
   - Hotkey to visible: < 0.5 seconds
   - Animations: 60fps minimum
   - No lag, no janky movements

3. **Personality Through Design** 💜
   - Animations convey emotion (even if AIs "don't have emotions" 😏)
   - Colors set the mood
   - Sounds enhance experience
   - Every detail has Cortana's personality
   - She jokes around - interface should too

4. **Usable, Not Just Pretty** 🎯
   - Easy to read responses
   - Clear input area
   - Simple to toggle features
   - Intuitive interactions

5. **Respectful of User** 🙏
   - Easy to turn off sounds
   - Easy to hide animations
   - Fast to dismiss
   - Doesn't demand attention

6. **Customizable Like Winamp** 🎨
   - User can swap themes/skins
   - Music/sounds easily replaceable
   - Show/hide sections
   - Make it your own

## Current Status

**Phase:** 1 (Design)  
**Status:** Ready to start  
**Next:** Begin design sprint (sketching, mockups, planning)

**Parallel Track:**
- Data collection continues automatically
- Interface design happens alongside
- Both ready when implementation time comes
