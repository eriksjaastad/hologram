# 🚀 Session: Hologram OS Master Architect Review

**Date:** 2025-12-18T20:30:00Z  
**AI Writer:** gemini-3-flash-preview  
**Project:** Hologram OS

## 📝 Executive Summary
Conducted a high-level architectural review of the **Hologram OS** roadmap. Cross-pollinated insights from mature projects (Trading Projects, Cortana, image-workflow, Hypocrisy Now) to tighten security, performance, and the "Sonique" aesthetic vision.

## 🛠️ Key Technical Pivots
1.  **Velocity Compression:** Compressed a 9-month roadmap into 2-week high-velocity sprints. Erik builds fast; the roadmap needed to match that cadence.
2.  **The "Red Switch" Integration:** Explicitly imported the risk management logic from the Trading Projects to handle high-token/high-cost AI calls.
3.  **GPU Resource Awareness:** Integrated GPU throttling logic derived from the Image Workflow video pipeline to ensure the Three.js visualizer doesn't starve media processing tasks.
4.  **Cortana as the Soul:** Defined the architecture to treat Cortana not as an external app, but as the primary memory connection for Hologram.

## 🧠 Strategic Insights
Hologram is the "Body" to Cortana's "Soul." By leveraging the `state.vscdb` pattern from Cursor and the local-first security model from Hypocrisy Now, we're building an interface that feels like the future (Sonique 1999 vibe) but operates with industrial-grade reliability (Trading Projects 2025 vibe).

## 🎯 Next Steps
- Initialize Electron project with transparent/frameless config.
- Port the Three.js "Breathing Sphere" into the Electron main process.
- Implement the OS Keychain adapter for secure API key handling.
