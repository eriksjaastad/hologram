# Hologram Development Roadmap

**Building a white-label AI Agent Operating System with soul**

---

## Vision

Create a desktop AI interface that:
- Supports **all major AI APIs** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, custom endpoints)
- Features **Sonique-inspired aesthetic** (biomorphic, kinetic, non-rectangular)
- Uses **Orchestrator Architecture** (Hub & Spoke - Cortana commands specialist sub-agents)
- Includes **MCP Support** for drag-and-drop skills
- Implements **Security Layer** with Green/Yellow/Red permission scopes
- Includes **full skin replacement system** (changes appearance AND personality)
- Integrates **hologram visualizer** (Three.js - always breathing, never frozen)
- Works as **menu bar app** with hotkey activation
- Treats **Cortana as one connection** among many
- **Local-only, zero telemetry** - users bring their own API keys

---

## Core Principles

### Product Stance
- **Local-first:** No cloud dependency for core functionality
- **Zero telemetry:** No analytics, crash reporting, or usage pings by default
- **User-owned keys:** Users supply their own API keys, stored in OS keychain
- **Direct connections:** App talks directly to provider endpoints (no relay servers)
- **Transparent network:** All network destinations are user-configured and visible
- **No background calls:** No automatic update checks, no phone-home, manual "Check for updates" only
- **Trust promise:** "No account. No cloud dependency. No background network calls. All network destinations are user-configured and visible."

### Trust & Security
- **API keys in OS keychain** (macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager)
- **Signed releases** with checksums
- **No logs with sensitive data** (keys never appear in logs)
- **Panic button:** One-click "Delete all keys"
- **Permission system:** Green/Yellow/Red risk levels with explicit authorization

### Design Philosophy
- **"The Window is a Lie"** (Sonique principle) - No rectangular constraints
- **Cool > Efficiency** - Revolutionary tech deserves revolutionary design
- **Visualizer NEVER stops** - Always breathing, even when idle
- **Build Orchestrator NOW** - Even if single path initially
- **The Mantra:** "If Sonique could make an MP3 player look like alien technology in 1999, we can make an AI interface look magical in 2025."

## Open Questions

### Architecture:
- Should conversation history sync across connections?
- How do we handle context windows (4K vs 128K)?
- Should we support local models (Ollama, LM Studio)?
- What's the performance impact of continuous visualizer on battery?
- ~~**Offline mode:** How should app behave when network is down?~~ **RESOLVED: Basic offline resilience in Phase 1**
  - ~~Cache last responses?~~ → v1.1
  - ~~Queue actions for retry?~~ → Basic queuing in v1.0, advanced in v1.1
  - ~~Detect network status?~~ → Phase 1 ✅

### Security & Privacy:
- Should we open-source the entire app or just key-handling code?
- How do we handle crash reports if no telemetry? (Manual export?)
- Should update checks be manual or opt-in auto?
- How do we verify community skins are safe?

### Design:
- How "weird" can we make the window shape before it's unusable?
- Should visualizer be always-on or toggleable?
- What's the default size/position?
- How many default skins should we ship with?

### Business:
- Is this open source or proprietary?
- Do we build a "Parent API" service for users without keys?
- Should we monetize? (Donations, paid skins, hosted version?)
- What's the liability if user's API keys are compromised?

### Features:
- Voice input/output? (TTS/STT)
- Plugin system for third-party extensions? (security concerns)
- Mobile companion app (future)?
- Collaboration features? (Share conversations?)

### Legal & Compliance:
- Do we need a privacy policy if we collect nothing?
- How do we handle DMCA for community skins?
- Provider terms compliance (are we a "competing service"?)
- Export controls on AI software?

## Session Log

### December 19, 2025 - Fresh Eyes "Scope Control" Review ✅

**Reviewer:** Anonymous fresh perspective (never seen project before)

**Focus:** Scope control, trust math, "will this ship?"

**Valid Concerns Raised:**

1. **Better "No Telemetry" Promise:**
   - Original: "Zero telemetry, transparent network calls"
   - **NEW:** "No account. No cloud dependency. No background network calls. All network destinations are user-configured and visible."
   - This is more specific and harder to accidentally violate
   - ✅ Adopted

2. **Action Catalog Missing:**
   - We have Green/Yellow/Red but no explicit list of what actions exist
   - **NEW:** Action Catalog v0 added to Phase 1 security foundation
   - Explicit list: network, filesystem (read/write/delete), shell, browser
   - v1.0 ships with only network + filesystem reads enabled by default
   - ✅ Added

3. **Battery When Hidden:**
   - Already had power saver mode, but not explicit pause when minimized
   - **NEW:** Pause visualizer when window minimized (1fps or paused)
   - ✅ Clarified

**Already Addressed:**
- Three hard problems → MCP/marketplace already on v1.1 cut list ✅
- Plugins = supply chain risk → Already sandboxed, Phase 6, v2-tier ✅
- Battery drain → Already had power saver, auto-disable when minimized ✅

**Reviewer's Verdict:** Valid scope concerns, mostly already handled, minor tweaks needed

**Status:** All tweaks applied ✅

---

### December 19, 2025 - Final Gemini Review: "Hidden Dragon" Found ✅

**Reviewer:** Gemini 3 Flash (Strategic Architect assisting with prompt creation)

**Status:** ✅ **FINAL PASS - READY TO BUILD**

**Critical Issue Identified:**
- **"Hidden Dragon"** - Router's intent classifier has circular dependency with offline state
- Problem: If Router uses LLM to classify intent, but we're offline, Security Layer is blind
- Example: User says "delete files" offline → Router can't ask GPT-4 what this means → Security can't assess risk
- **Solution:** Router needs local pattern matching (regex/keywords) that works 100% offline
- Cloud LLM only for ambiguous cases when online

**Roadmap Update:**
- ✅ Added local intent classification requirement to Phase 1, Week 1-2
- ✅ Security assessment must work offline (no cloud dependency for basic patterns)
- ✅ Pattern libraries for Red/Yellow/Green actions defined locally

**Key Quote:**
> "You cannot wait for the cloud to tell you if a user is trying to delete files."

**Gemini's Verdict:**
- Roadmap matured from "Vision Board" to "Engineering Spec"
- Timeline honest (42+ weeks)
- Security stance ironclad
- **Status: READY TO BUILD**

**Phase 0 Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

- GPT-5.1 Codex Max review
- Grok Code Fast review

**UNPRECEDENTED CONSENSUS: All 5 reviewers gave "CONDITIONAL PASS" ⚠️**

**Critical Issues Identified (100% Agreement):**

1. **OFFLINE MODE MUST BE PHASE 1** ⚠️
   - All 5 reviewers independently flagged this
   - Cannot claim "Local-First" if app crashes when WiFi disconnects
   - Quote (Grok): "Positioning offline mode in 'Technical Debt' is architecturally dishonest"
   - **RESOLVED:** Moved to Phase 1, Week 3-4

2. **SECURITY LAYER BEFORE ORCHESTRATOR** ⚠️
   - All 5 detected dependency inversion
   - Quote (Claude): "Building the roof before the foundation"
   - Orchestrator dispatches actions, so Security Layer must exist first
   - **RESOLVED:** Restructured Phase 1 (Security foundation Week 1-2, Orchestrator stub Week 3-4)

3. **TIMELINE IS UNREALISTIC** ⚠️
   - Opus: 48-52 weeks actual
   - Claude: 42-44 weeks
   - Grok: 52-60 weeks
   - All agree 36 weeks is 30-40% too optimistic
   - **ACKNOWLEDGED:** Realistic estimate now 42-52 weeks

4. **GPU MONITORING INSUFFICIENT** ⚠️
   - All 5 flag missing: VRAM tracking, WebGL context limits, draw call budgets
   - **RESOLVED:** Enhanced Phase 4 with comprehensive GPU metrics

**Roadmap Updates Made (v2.0 → v3.0):**

- ✅ **Phase 1 Restructured:**
  - Week 1-2: Electron + Router + Security Foundation
  - Week 3-4: Visualizer + Orchestrator Stub + Offline Resilience
  
- ✅ **Offline Mode Added to Phase 1:**
  - Network status detection
  - Graceful degradation (visualizer + history work offline)
  - Message queuing for retry
  - ~14 hours effort (all reviewers agreed minimal)

- ✅ **Security Layer Enhancements (Phase 2):**
  - Log rotation and sanitization
  - Conversation encryption
  - PII detection in logs
  - Clear logs/history buttons

- ✅ **GPU Monitoring Enhanced (Phase 4):**
  - VRAM vs System RAM tracking
  - Texture/draw call/triangle count monitoring
  - WebGL context loss handling
  - Shader compilation time tracking
  - Performance budgets defined

- ✅ **Timeline Reality Acknowledged:**
  - Original: 36 weeks
  - Realistic: 42-52 weeks
  - 24-week forced ship: Requires cut list (documented)

**The "24-Week Cut List" (All 5 Agreed):**
1. Phase 6 (MCP Integration) → v1.1
2. Phase 7 (Skin Community Features) → v1.1
3. Phase 8 (Cortana Special Integration) → v1.1
4. Phase 5 (Advanced Sonique) → Reduce to basic non-rectangular

**Key Insight:**
The level of consensus across 5 different AI models is extraordinary. When completely independent reviewers all identify the same issues, it's a strong signal those issues are real.

### December 18-19, 2025 - Four-Review Consensus (Day 2, Round 1)

**Completed:**
- Opus 4.5 comprehensive architecture review
- Grok detailed code review
- GPT-5.1.1 Codex max review  
- Gemini 3 Flash Preview strategic review

**Strong Consensus Across All 4 Reviews:**
1. **Cross-pollination is critical** - Reuse patterns from Trading, Cortana, Agent OS, Image Workflow, Hypocrisy Now
2. **Timeline realism** - Phase 1 needs 6-8 weeks (not 4), implementation 2-3x longer than docs
3. **GPU/Performance gaps** ⚠️ - All 4 flagged: GPU memory leaks, battery impact, need monitoring
4. **Offline mode missing** ⚠️ - Network detection, cache responses, queue actions

**Roadmap Updates Made:**
- ✅ Added GPU/performance monitoring to Phase 4 (FPS counter, memory leak testing, power saver mode)
- ✅ Added API key rotation button to Phase 2
- ✅ Added request/response logging (sanitized) to Phase 2
- ✅ Added crash recovery (auto-save conversation) to Phase 2
- ✅ Added explicit File Agent safety rules to Phase 3 (move-not-modify, audit logs, companions)
- ✅ Added Three.js bundling check to Phase 1
- ✅ Added offline mode to Open Questions and Technical Debt
- ✅ Added conversation export and rate limit tracking to Technical Debt

**Key Quote from Gemini:**
> "Hologram is the 'Body' to Cortana's 'Soul.' By leveraging the local-first security model... we're building an interface that feels like the future (Sonique 1999 vibe) but operates with industrial-grade reliability (Trading Projects 2025 vibe)."

**Review Documents:**
- `docs/reviews/OPUS_4.5_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/reviews/GROK_CODE_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/reviews/gpt5.1.1.md`
- `docs/reviews/gemini-3-flash-preview__hologram-roadmap-review.md`

**Next Steps:**
- Round 2 reviews with fresh contexts (if needed for consensus check)
- Finalize Phase 0 after review feedback
- Begin Phase 1 implementation

### December 18-19, 2025 - Master Architect Review (Day 2)

**Completed:**
- Claude Opus 4.5 comprehensive architecture review
- Cross-pollination analysis across Erik's 5 major projects
- Detailed sprint breakdowns with realistic time estimates
- Definition of Done checklists for v1.0
- Gap detection and risk register

**New Document Created:**
- `OPUS_4.5_REVIEW.md` - Complete strategic review by Claude Opus 4.5

**Key Cross-Pollination Discoveries:**
1. **Agent OS** → Use kernel architecture, db.py pattern, plugin interface
2. **Cortana Personal AI** → Port 4-layer safety architecture, circuit breakers
3. **Trading Projects** → Adapt risk classification, API retry patterns
4. **Hypocrisy Now** → Apply offline-first philosophy, connection pooling (future)
5. **Image Workflow** → Adopt code quality rules, FileTracker patterns

**Revised Timeline:**
- Phase 1 (original 4 weeks) → **6-8 weeks** (Three.js + Electron complexity)
- Phase 2 (original 4 weeks) → **4-5 weeks** (well-defined security layer)
- Phase 3 (original 4 weeks) → **5-6 weeks** (multi-API coordination)

**Strategic Insight:**
Hologram is the **UI layer** that unifies:
- Agent OS (kernel/runtime)
- Cortana (memory/personality backend)
- Trading (risk patterns)

**Next Steps:**
1. Erik reviews ARCHITECT_REVIEW.md
2. Initialize Electron project with transparency config
3. Port Agent OS db.py to TypeScript
4. Begin Sprint 1.1 (Electron Foundation)

### December 18, 2025 - Project Launch (Day 1)

**Major Events:**
- Project created (split from Cortana interface)
- Gemini insight: "AI companies use boring chat windows"
- Erik's pivot: "Why don't we make a white label version?"
- Hologram born as standalone project
- **Second pivot:** Agent Operating System (Hub & Spoke architecture)
- ChatGPT security review completed

**Decisions Made:**
- Desktop app (Electron)
- Menu bar mode
- Sonique aesthetic (non-rectangular, biomorphic)
- **Orchestrator pattern** from day one
- **MCP integration** (not "later" - build socket now)
- Skin system changes appearance AND personality
- Multi-AI support as core feature
- **Local-only, zero telemetry** as hard requirement
- **Security layer** (Green/Yellow/Red permissions)

**Documents Created:**
- README.md (project overview)
- CLAUDE.md (AI collaborator context)
- ROADMAP.md (this file - comprehensive plan)
- SESSION_NOTES_DAY_1.md (detailed session notes)
- IMPLEMENTATION_DIRECTIVES.md (developer bible)
- ORCHESTRATOR_ARCHITECTURE.md (Hub & Spoke design)
- API_ABSTRACTION_LAYER.md (multi-AI support)
- Hologram_LocalOnly_Concerns_and_Checklist.pdf (security review)

**The Energy:**
- Erik went from "I need to get to work" to "wait, one more thing..." THREE TIMES
- His brain "lit up" when discussing the interface
- Nearly missed work deadline because of excitement
- This is the sign of something special 🔥

**Key Quote:**
> "If Sonique could make an MP3 player look like alien technology in 1999, we can make an AI interface look magical in 2025."

**Next Session:**
- Get advisor feedback on this roadmap
- Revisions based on feedback
- Finalize Phase 0
- Initialize Git repository
- Begin Phase 1 when ready

### December 18-19, 2025 - Security Review

**Completed:**
- ChatGPT security consultation
- Legal/compliance concerns documented
- Product stance clarified (local-only, no telemetry)
- Security checklist integrated into roadmap
- All concerns from PDF extracted and incorporated

**Key Insights from ChatGPT:**
- "Zero data collected" is fragile - use "No account. No cloud. No telemetry."
- API keys in OS keychain is the right model
- Direct-to-provider connections reduce terms risk
- Skins should be assets only (no code execution)
- Plugins need sandbox + explicit permissions
- Signed releases + checksums = trust signals

**Security Decisions:**
- Default to no telemetry (no exceptions)
- Manual update checks (or explicit opt-in)
- Skins are visual only (v1.0)
- Plugins postponed until sandboxing ready
- One-click "Delete all keys" panic button
- Keys never in logs, console, or error messages

## Notes

### Philosophy:
- **"Janky compass, not detailed map"** - iterate and adjust
- **"Cool > Efficiency"** - spend the CPU on magic
- **Priority:** Cool factor > feature completeness
- **Timeline:** Flexible - adjust based on feedback and discoveries
- **Success Metric:** "Does this make talking to AI feel special?"

### For Advisors Reviewing This Roadmap:

**We need feedback on:**
1. **Security model** - Is local-only + OS keychain sufficient?
2. **Phase ordering** - Should we build differently?
3. **Open source** - All, some, or none?
4. **Legal concerns** - Privacy policy needed? DMCA handling?
5. **Provider compliance** - Are we violating any terms?
6. **Monetization** - If any, what's ethical?
7. **Scope** - Is this too ambitious for v1.0?

**What we're confident about:**
- The vision (revolutionary tech deserves revolutionary design)
- The architecture (Orchestrator pattern is sound)
- The security stance (local-only, no telemetry)
- The user model (bring your own keys)

**What we're uncertain about:**
- Legal/compliance edge cases
- Community content moderation (skins)
- Plugin security model
- Business sustainability
